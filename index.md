[Submitty](http://submitty.org) is an open source homework
submission and grading system from the 
[Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software (RCOS)](https://rcos.io/), 
hosted by the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/) 
at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://www.rpi.edu/).  System 
administration support and documentation is provided by the 
[Department of Computer Science Labstaff](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/foswiki/bin/view/LabstaffWeb/WebHome).


The Submitty system allows students to electronically submit
programming assignments.  The submissions are compiled, tested, and
validated (auto-graded) following scripts prepared by the instructor.
The Submitty system also manages offline/human grading of homework
assignments, data entry of grades for other components of the course,
and presentation of grades for each component as well as the overall
semester grades to the students.
