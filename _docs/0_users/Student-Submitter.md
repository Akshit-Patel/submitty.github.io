### Accessing the Homework Submission Server

1.  What is the Homework Submission Server URL for your course?  (Your
instructor should provide this information.)  Load this URL in your
favorite web browser.

2.  Have your credentials ready.  (Again, your instructor should
provide this information.)  If you have trouble
authenticating/accessing the page, double check the URL and your
username and password, and contact the instructor, TA, or system
administrator as appropriate.

### Main Navigation Page

Once logged in, the student view displays all available assignments
organized in reverse chronological order into several categories:

  * "Open" (accepting submissions for a homework deadline that is in the
     future).  

  * "Past Due" (depending on the course rules regarding acceptance of
    late work, or special extensions granted to the student,
    submission may still be allowed.   

  * "Closed"

  * "Grades Available"

### Uploading a New Submission

1. After selecting the appropriate assignment, the student should
   prepare their work for upload.  Carefully read both your course
   syllabus & and any specific instructions for this assignment.  Your
   instructor has configured the submission site with one or
   submission areas.  You may:

     * "Drag and drop" one or more files into each submission area, or
     * Click on a submission area, which will bring up a file browser
       allowing you to select one or more files for upload.

   If you upload choose to load a .zip file, the files within this
   .zip file will be extracted on upload.  If your .zip file contains
   one or more folders/directories, the folder/directory structure
   will be preserved.

   Alternatively, if you instructor has configured this assignment to
   receive files via version control (SVN) the submission interface
   will consist of a button, allowing you to indicate that the system
   should grab your most recent materials from the repository for
   grading.

2.  As you collect files for submission, if you make a mistake you may
remove files by clicking on the trashcan icon.  Or you may press
"Clear" to remove all files.  Or, if you have already submitted to
this assignment, you may press "Get Most Recent Files" to initialize
the submission with those materials.  You can then delete or add new
files.

3.  Once you have selected all necessary files, press "Submit".

4.  Wait patiently for your assignment to be graded.  The page will
automatically refresh when grading is complete.  If the assignment is
computationally intensive or if the server is busy grading your
classmates work, you may need to wait longer.

5.  If you find an error or omission with your submission, you can
repeat the steps above to upload a new version of the code.

### Reviewing Previous Submissions

1.  The server stores all uploaded files and all automated grading results for each of your submissions.

2.  You may review the results of automated grading for the most recent submission or any prior submission by choosing that version from the "Select Submission Version:" drop down menu.

3.  The webpage displays a summary of the results on the test cases configured by your instructor.  

4.  If the test case is configured to award automated grading points, a green, yellow, red, or gray token appears next to each test.  Green means full credit, yellow is partial credit, red is low or no credit.  The gray token appears if the test is extra credit or hidden. 

5.  If more details are available for a specific test case, a "Details" link will appear on the right side.  You may click on this link or on the title of the test case to toggle expansion of these details.  _NOTE: Additional details are intentionally not available for hidden test cases._

### Reverting to an earlier Submission

1.  By default, the server marks as "Active" your most recent submission (with the highest version number).

2.  Your "Active" submission is the version which will be graded by the teaching assistant and recorded in the gradebook.

3.  If you would like to set a submission version other than your last submission as "Active", you may do so by selecting that version from the "Select Submission Version:" drop-down menu, and then pressing the "Set Version XX as ACTIVE Submission Version" button.   

4.  Note:  You may not change the "Active" version after TA grading has begun.


### Accessing (Non-automated) TA Grades and Semester Averages

1.  When the TA grading has been completed, and the instructor has released these grades, a summary report of the TA grading will appear below the summary of the automated grading.  

2.  Contact the grading TA if you have questions about the TA grading portion.
