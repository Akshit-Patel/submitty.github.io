### TA Navigation Page

When a TA or Grader user logs into the course, they have access to the
same submissions links as the student (left column of colored
buttons).  But in addition, they have an additional column of buttons
to the right, to review the student submissions and enter grades for
each assignment.

After selecting an assignment, the TA is presented with an overview of
their assigned grading for this assignment.  

The TA can then click to see an index page of all students in their
assigned sections:

Students who have not yet be assigned a TA grade appear as blue
"Grade" buttons.

Clicking on one of the "Grade" buttons brings up the multi-pane TA
grading interface.  The 4 panes are:

* Automated Test Case Results (red border)

* File and Directory Browser (blue border) - displays the tree
  hierachy of files and directories.  The grader can expand to view
  any of the files, or "pop out" a browser window to view a single
  file.

* Grading Rubric (green) - divided into one or more components specified

* Student Information (black)

After completing the grading of this student and pressing "Submit" the
TA returns to the index page and the "Grade" button for that student
is replaced with a white button and the student's TA score for that
assignment.

We have two categories of "TA" or "Grader" users with increased access
to data for the course.  We call these users "Full Access Graders" or
"Limited Access Graders".
