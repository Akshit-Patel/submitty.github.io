_FIXME: WE WILL RENAME THIS FILE TO "MANUAL SETUP OF LIVE SERVER" (OR
SIMILAR), ONCE WE HAVE REMOVED ALL OF THE MANY OUTDATED FILES NAMED
"SETUP"._


These instructions below and the automated installation scripts assume
you are running Submitty on a dedicated machine (or virtual machine).


1. [Install Ubuntu 16.04 server edition](server_os)


2. After installing the operating system, clone the git repository:  

   ```
   mkdir -p /usr/local/submitty  
   git clone https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty.git /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT_Submitty
   ```


3. Run the automated portion of the install.  Note, this file 

   ```
   cd /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT_Submitty  
   ./.setup/install_system.sh
   ```

   You will be asked several questions by the 
   [CONFIGURE_SUBMITTY.sh script](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/.setup/CONFIGURE_SUBMITTY.sh).
   Unless you have a database server already set up, it is practical
   to use localhost.  We use `hsdbu` for the database user, but any
   userid that is not used for something else will suffice.  Do not
   enable debugging unless you are developing code on a non-production
   machine.


4. Edit PHP Settings
   Edit `/etc/php/7.0/fpm/php.ini`  and find the entry for disable_functions and prepend the list of disabled functions with:
   ```
popen,pclose,proc_open,chmod,php_real_logo_guid,php_egg_logo_guid,php_ini_scanned_files,php_ini_loaded_file,readlink,symlink,link,set_file_buffer,proc_close,proc_terminate,proc_get_status,proc_nice,getmyuid,getmygid,getmyinode,putenv,get_current_user,magic_quotes_runtime,set_magic_quotes_runtime,import_request_variables,ini_alter,stream_socket_client,stream_socket_server,stream_socket_accept,stream_socket_pair,stream_get_transports,stream_wrapper_restore,mb_send_mail,openlog,syslog,closelog,pfsockopen,posix_kill,apache_child_terminate,apache_get_modules,apache_get_version,apache_lookup_uri,apache_reset_timeout,apache_response_headers,virtual,system,phpinfo,exec,shell_exec,passthru,
   ```


5. Clean up Apache configs

   You probably want to first disable or remove the default
   configurations to prevent unintended access to the web server (but
   donâ€™t do this if the default site is already in use).

   ```
   rm /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf 
   rm /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf
   rm /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
   rm /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf
   ```

   You may also want to comment out the directory specific portions of
   ``` /etc/apache2/apache2.conf ``` so that you do not risk
   configuration conflicts with your other configurations.  (Things
   that begin with Directory and end with /Directory).


   Edit ``` /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf ``` to ensure
   these options below are set to limit the information the server
   gives to potential hackers:

   ```
   ServerTokens Prod
   ServerSignature Off
   ```


6.  We strongly recommend using `https`.  You will need 2 certificates
    from a trusted Certificate Authority.  [Let's
    Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a recent no-cost option to
    obtain certificates.

    One of these certificates will be for your primary website, e.g.: 
    
    ```
    https://submitty.youruniversity.edu
    ```

    The other certificate will be for cgi, e.g.:

    ```
    https://submitty-cgi.youruniversity.edu
    ```

    Note that "snake oil" certificates will probably not work.

    Alternately, if you are setting up a machine only for Submitty
    development, you can configure your system to use `http`.  We
    strongly advise against using http for a live production machine.


7.  Copy the starter apache configurations from the GIT repository:
  
    ```cp Docs/sample_apache_config /etc/apache2/sites-available/submit-ssl.conf```  
    ```cp Docs/cgi.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/cgi.conf```  

    and update the ip address for the VirtualHost, ServerAdmin,
    ServerName, DocumentRoot, paths, and SSL key locations as needed.
    Use

    ```a2ensite submit-ssl```  
    ```a2ensite cgi```  

    to enable the configurations.

8.  Edit the sites in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/` to point to your
    SSL certificate(s).

        _FILLIN THESE INSTRUCTIONS_


9. You need to either comment out the system call to validate.auth.pl
   in **/var/local/submitty/bin/authonly.pl** and **new.svn.user.pl**
   or populate **/var/local/submitty/instructors/valid** with a list
   of valid userids.  If all valid users already have an account on
   the machine, one way to do this is:

   ```
   ls /home > /var/local/sumitty/instructors/valid
   ```


10. Set up ssh keys for hwcron to be able to connect to the subversion
    server without a password

    ```
    su hwcron
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 
    ssh-copy-id hwcron@<svnhost>    
    ```

11. Add the postgres user to the shadow group on your database machine so that
    it can access the system file for authentication

    ```
    adduser postgres shadow
    ```

12. Edit `/root/bin/top.txt` and `/root/bin/bottom.txt` to make sure they
    are pointed at the right path, using the right SSL keys, and have
    any customizations you need.  (edit `SSLCertificateFile`,
    `SSLCertificateKeyFile`, and comment out `SSLCertificatChainFile` in
    `bottom.txt` if you are using a snakeoil certificate)


13. Edit `/root/bin/gen.middle` to make sure `$dir` is set correctly, the
    `AuthName` reflects what you use, and that the "require group" line
    has the right group name for your course.

14. Test apache config with:  `apache2ctl -t` 
    If everything looks ok, restart apache with:  `service apache2 restart'
