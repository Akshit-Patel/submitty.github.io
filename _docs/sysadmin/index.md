To create a production server, you'll need a machine with Ubuntu 16.04
server edition, an SSL certificate, a Postgres database, and an SVN
server (if needed). The details for each step are listed in the sidebar.

After the machine is prepared, you'll then need to follow the course
creation instructions for each course that will be supported on that
machine.

Be sure to review the 
[System Customization Checklist](/sysadmin/system_customization).
