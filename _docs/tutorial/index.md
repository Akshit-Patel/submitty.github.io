#### Demo Submitty

We provide access to an online interface to Submitty for interested parties. We are happy to provide access to any 
interested instructor to a demo course on our Submitty machine to test the system out. You will receive an instructor 
account to your own course where you can upload autograder configs, and manaage aspects of your course. You will also 
receive a student account on the tutorial course where you can submit to the gradeables that are talked about above in 
our Demo presentation.
