#### Demo Submitty

As part of our SIGCSE 2017 demo presentation we are hosting a demo
Submitty website.  Please contact us at
[submitty@cs.rpi.edu](mailto:submitty@cs.rpi.edu) for access
credentials to this demo site.

With these credentials you will have access as a "student" to the
tutorial course where you can upload sample student submissions and
view the autograding results.  You will also have access as an
"instructor" to your own course populated with a couple dozen students
that you can grade, you can create new "gradeables", upload new
autograder configs, and manage your course.

Alternatively, you may follow the [developer
instructions](/developer/) to setup a private VM running
Submitty on your own machine.
