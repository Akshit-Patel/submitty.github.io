### What are Team Assignments?

Team Assignments are assignments where students form teams and each team submits one assignment and is given one grade. In a sense, each team is its own student for the sake of the team assignment. Only one student from the team needs to submit for the entire team. The entire team shares submissions and late days (one late day used by the team uses a late from **each** student on the team).

As you can see from the screenshot below, a team grade is displayed in the same format as a normal assignment.

### Creating a Team

After clicking on the manage team page, you will be given the option to create a new team or to seek a team or partner.

If you select ```Create New Team```, you will be shown the team management portal. Here you can invite more students and see who is on your team.

Once you are on a team, you can view your teammates through the “Manage Team” portal.

### Seek Team/Partner

When a user clicks the ```Seek Team/Partner``` button, they will show up in the table below. From here, other users are able to invite them through the “Invite new teammates by their user ID” interface documented above.

### Joining a Team

If you receive an invite, it will be shown next to who sent the invite on the manage team screen. All you have to do is select accept to join the team.

### Locked Teams

Your instructor can at any time lock the teams. The manage team button will then change to a view team button. Once that happens, you will be unable to change your team.

If you were unable to form a team by the time teams were locked, you may accept any invitations that were sent before the team was locked or create a team by yourself.
