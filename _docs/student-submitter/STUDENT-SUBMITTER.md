_FIXME: THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL NEED TO BE UPDATED WITH THE NEW
INSTRUCTIONS AND SCREENSHOTS OF THE NEW USER INTERFACE_


### Accessing the Homework Submission Server

1.  What is the Homework Submission Server URL for your course?  (Your
instructor should provide this information.)  Load this URL in your
favorite web browser.

2.  Have your credentials ready.  (Again, your instructor should
provide this information.)  If you have trouble
authenticating/accessing the page, double check the URL and your
username and password, and contact the instructor, TA, or system
administrator as appropriate.


### Uploading a new submission

1.  What should you submit?  Carefully read both your course syllabus
& and any specific instructions for this assignment.  Your instructor
has configured the submission site to either:

     * directly accept a single file or a zip file contain one or more files / subdirectories, or 
     * accept submissions via SVN (Subversion version control)

    Collect the necessary files for submission. 

2.  Use the pulldown menu at the top of the page to select the homework you would like to submit.

3.  If your course is configured to directly accept the files _(not through SVN)_ select the individual file or zip file location on your local machine.

4.  Press Submit.

5.  Wait patiently for your assignment to be graded.  The page will automatically refresh when grading is complete.  If the assignment is computationally intensive or if it is a busy submission time and your classmates are also using the server you may need to wait longer.

6.  If you find an error or omission with your submission, you can repeat the steps above to upload a new version of the code.

### Reviewing Previous Submissions

1.  The server stores all uploaded files and all automated grading results for each of your submissions.

2.  You may review the results of automated grading for the most recent submission or any prior submission by choosing that version from the "Select Submission Version:" drop down menu.

3.  The webpage displays a summary of the results on the test cases configured by your instructor.  

4.  If the test case is configured to award automated grading points, a green, yellow, red, or gray token appears next to each test.  Green means full credit, yellow is partial credit, red is low or no credit.  The gray token appears if the test is extra credit or hidden. 

5.  If more details are available for a specific test case, a "Details" link will appear on the right side.  You may click on this link or on the title of the test case to toggle expansion of these details.  _NOTE: Additional details are intentionally not available for hidden test cases._

### Reverting to an earlier Submission

1.  By default, the server marks as "Active" your most recent submission (with the highest version number).

2.  Your "Active" submission is the version which will be graded by the teaching assistant and recorded in the gradebook.

3.  If you would like to set a submission version other than your last submission as "Active", you may do so by selecting that version from the "Select Submission Version:" drop-down menu, and then pressing the "Set Version XX as ACTIVE Submission Version" button.   

4.  Note:  You may not change the "Active" version after TA grading has begun.


### Accessing (Non-automated) TA Grades and Semester Averages

1.  When the TA grading has been completed, and the instructor has released these grades, a summary report of the TA grading will appear below the summary of the automated grading.  

2.  Contact the grading TA if you have questions about the TA grading portion.
