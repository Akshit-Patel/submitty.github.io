As a developer, you'll need to set up the full system on your own
computer.  The easiest method is to 
[run the system within a virtual machine (VM)](VM-Install-Using-Vagrant).
Alternately, you can install the system natively on a dedicated
computer and allow outside access (which requires more steps to set up
networking, SSL/https, etc.) by following the
[complete system administrator instructions][System Administrator].



Please contribute by adding bugs or feature requests to our 
[Submitty GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues).


To contribute your software changes back to this open source project,
follow these steps:

  1. Run the [C++ Test Suite](Local-Test-Suite) locally.

  2. Push your work to an appropriately named new branch on GitHub.

  3. When your code has passed all of the [Travis CI Tests](Travis-CI), then
     you can make a pull request to master.
