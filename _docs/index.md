[Submitty](http://submitty.org) is an open source programming
assignment submission system from the 
[Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software (RCOS)](https://rcos.io/), 
launched by the
[Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/) at
[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://www.rpi.edu/).

[The Submitty project is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/Submitty/). 

Students can submit their code by drag-and-drop, zip upload, or
version control, where it is then tested with a highly configurable
and customizable automated grader. Students receive immediate feedback
from the automated grader, and can resubmit to correct errors as
needed. Through an online interface, TAs can access detailed grading
results and supplement the automated scores with manual grading
(numeric and written feedback) of overall program structure, good use
of comments, reasonable error checking, etc. and any non-programming
components of the assignment. The instructor can also configure the
system to allow for a configurable late day policy on a per assignment
and per student basis.

Submitty is installed locally and is able to support multiple separate
courses, each with hundreds of students and multiple TAs and
instructors.
