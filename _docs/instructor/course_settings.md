### Course Settings

From an instructor/head TA account, you can select "Course Settings"
and change the course name, and a few default settings for late days,
homework submission, and TA grading.


### Manage Users

Use the "Students" and "Users" options to view the lists of people
with access to your course.  Use the "Manage Users" option to add/edit
access for your TAs and mentors.  

Use the "Setup Rotating Sections" option to distribute your student
list into equal sections for grading assignments other than
registration section.  See also:  [Registration Section vs. Rotating Section](create_edit_gradeable#grading-by-registration-section-or-rotating-section)


### Late Days Management

Use the "Late Days Allowed" option to change the number of late days
allowed per student.  These new late days may be used for any future
homeworks.  This is useful if you want to award late days as an
incentive.

Use the "Excused Absense Extensions" to grant an extension of a
specific number of days for a specific assignment.  This is useful
when the student has an excused absense.  These late days cannot be
used on other assignments.


### Grades Summaries

Use "Grade Summaries" option to export data for use with
[Iris (Rainbow Grades)](iris_rainbow_grades).

Or export to CSV using the "CSV Report" option.
