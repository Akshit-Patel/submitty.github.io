### Creating a Team Assignment

To create a team assignment, simply select “Yes” under the “Is this a team assignment?” section when creating a gradeable.

This will open a new option for maximum team size, which refers to the maximum number of members that can join a team (including the student who creates it).

### Team Lock Date

After creating the gradeable, there will be an option under the Dates tab to set the team lock date, which will be the last date students cam create new teams or invite new members to existing teams.

### Creating Teams

Instructors also have the option of making teams for the students.

After opening grading for the team assignment, there are two different ways instructors can make teams:
* Press the ```Import Teams Members``` button in the upper right to import teams (format of the teams should be csv with 6 columns: First Name, Last Name, User ID, Team ID, Team Registration Section, Team Rotating Section. The first row of the csv is assumed to be column headings and is ignored)
* Press the pencil icon in the Edit Teams column for a student you'd like to put on a team to bring up the interface for creating a team

Once a team has been made, the ```Import Teams Members``` button becomes ```Export Teams Members```, and clicking it will download a csv with the current teams, which can then be imported into another team assignment.
