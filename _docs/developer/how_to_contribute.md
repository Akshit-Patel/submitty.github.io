* Each pull request (PR) should be addressing/closing an open issue.
  *Usually*.

* The PR title should be useful and descriptive (not just the issue#).

* Titles of PR, Issues, and commits should be <= 50 characters.
  *Usually*.

* Include the string "Closes #1234" within the comment so that the
  issue will be automatically closed issue when the pull request is
  merged.

* The commit message should talk about *WHAT* changed, and *WHY*. Not
  *HOW*.  How is the diff, and you donâ€™t need to repeat it.

* Comments explaining the code should be *in* the code, rather than in
  the PR message or comments.

* Including screenshots in the issue or PR message is helpful for UI
  changes.

* The comments should explain a bit about the purpose/history/overview
  -- don't assume the reader knows it (or link to the issue that
  explains everything).

* Be explicit about what you want feedback on, or why you are asking
  for specific reviewers.
