The projects listed below are roughly ordered by prior experience
required.  Work has already begun on many of these projects, but we
are looking for new team members to join these projects.  Submit
questions or comments on specific issues through our
[Submitty GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues)
or [Contact us](http://submitty.org/index) to join the
development team.


1. **Peer Grading**   

   Currently we facilitate detailed rubric manual grading of student
   assignments by the instructor or TA.  We have extended this design
   to include peer assessment, which can aid timeliness, quantity, and
   quality of feedback for students in large courses with limited
   instructional resources and has been shown to provide important
   benefit for the peer graders as well.  Students can be assigned to
   review and critique grade a small number of their classmates' work.
   This core implementation of peer grading is in progress, but
   incomplete.

   [Open Issues related to Peer Grading](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+peer)

   Advanced features related to peer grading:

   * Evaluating the quality of peer grading ("grading the grader") by
     comparing peer grades

   * Security (ensuring students only see the submission material of
     peers they have been assigned to grade)

   * Privacy/Anonymity (providing an option to redact student names
     from material seen by peers).

   Experience Required: Some programming experience, willingness to
   learn web and database development.


2. **Instructor interface for Plagiarism Detection**

   The implementatino of the core plagiarism detection algorithm is
   complete and we have an initial visualization of similarities
   between the top matching pairs of assignment submissions.

   Experience Required: Some programming experience, willingness to
   learn web and database development.


5. **Discussion Forum**

   A new feature for Spring 2018 is a Discussion Forum where
   instructors can post announcements, students can ask questions,
   instructors/TAs/other students can answer questions, students can
   share images, etc.  

   [Open Issues related to Forum](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+forum)

   Advanced features related to the Discussion Forum:

   * Team chat

   * Notifications

   Experience Required: Some programming experience, willingness to
   learn web and database development.


3. **Web GUI for creating automated grading configurations**

   Currently instructors must write a configuration as a config.json
   (and any necessary additional files) and upload or store these
   files on the local file system.  We would like to provide an
   alternate web GUI interface for creating basic on moderately
   complex autograding configurations.  The goal would be to
   streamline the assignment configuration process for non-technical
   instructors, relevant for use in
   non-computer-science/non-programming courses.

   Experience Required: Some programming experience, willingness to
   learn web and database development.  Having served as a teaching
   assistant or instructor with experience in programming assignment
   design is helpful.
