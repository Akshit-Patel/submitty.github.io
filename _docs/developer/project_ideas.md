1. **Peer Grading**   

   We provide a detailed rubric for manual grading of student
   assignments by the instructor or TA.  We have extended this design
   for use by peers.  Students can be assigned to review and critique
   grade a small number of their classmates work.  This core
   implementation is in progress, but incomplete.

   * Evaluating the quality of peer grading ("grading the grader") by
     comparing peer grades

   * Security (ensuring students only see the submission material of
     peers they have been assigned to grade)

   * Privacy/Anonymity (providing an option to redact student names
     from material seen by peers).



2. **Instructor interface for Plagiarism Detection**

   The implementatino of the core plagiarism detection algorithm is
   complete and we have an initial visualization of similarities
   between the top matching pairs of assignment submissions.

3. **Web GUI for creating automated grading configurations**

   Currently instructors must write a configuration as a config.json
   (and any necessary additional files) and upload or store these
   files on the local file system.  We would like to provide an
   alternate web GUI interface for
