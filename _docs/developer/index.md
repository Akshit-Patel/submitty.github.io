title: Developer

As a developer, you'll need to set up the full system on your own
computer.  The easiest method is to 
[run the system within a virtual machine (VM)](vm_install_using_vagrant).
Alternately, you can install the system natively on a dedicated
computer and allow outside access (which requires more steps to set up
networking, SSL/https, etc.) by following the
[complete system administrator instructions](/sysadmin).



Please contribute by adding bugs or feature requests to our 
[Submitty GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues).


A list of Submitty projects (some new, some in progress):  
[Project Ideas](project_ideas)


To contribute your software changes back to this open source project,
follow these steps:

  1. Run the [C++ Test Suite](autograding_tests) locally.

  2. Push your work to an appropriately named new branch on GitHub.

  3. When your code has passed all of the [Travis CI Tests](travis_ci), then
     you can make a pull request to master.



## Suggestions for new developers


* Look through the issues list

* Learn what sections of the code are relevant (so you’re not overwhelmed)

* Add & delete things to see what happens

* Use inspector, browser debugger

* Learn how to use git

* Use “git grep” to search for variables/filenames within the files/directories

* As you read the code, make a diagram for yourself of how the system fits together

* Use jsfiddle (for testing or demoing new things)

* Keep a work diary / log: what did you plan to do today, keep track
  of how long it took you to do things, difficulties, how did you
  solve it, helpful reference links, and what’s your plan for tomorrow

* Get familiar with vagrant ( instructions on the wiki)

* Run the test suite locally
